## DATASET Used

- The dataset is from Kaggle:  
  https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india

- important :  DOWNLOAD city_hour.csv , station_hour.csv , stations.csv code to execute.

- It was made by merging two files:  
  - `station_hour.csv`: Contains hourly pollutant levels and AQI values  
  - `stations.csv`: Contains station details like city, state, and location coordinates  

- The files were joined using the `StationId` to connect pollutant data with station information.
